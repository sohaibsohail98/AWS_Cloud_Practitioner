## Getting Started: Create individual IAM User:

### Creating an individual user:

**Head over to the AWS's IAM (Identity and Access Management) page. This should list the remaining steps needed to secure the AWS account.**

**Under "Create individual IAM users", head over to:**

```
Manage Users
```

**Once we click on add users, we need to allocate user access.**
 
 - In this case, the user will get "Programmatic access" and "AWS Management Console access". This enables access key ID and secret access key for AWS and more development tools. It also enables a password for users to sign in to the AWS management console. The console password will be autogenerated to maintain security. It will require change when the user logins in next.
 
 - To set permissions, the user needs to create a group to add the user to. 
 
 - The pop of creating a group will provide options for permissions. In this case, we will be giving "AdministratorAccess". However, its important to note that not more than a few will get this access.
 
 - Most users will get "PowerUserAccess" - this is full access to AWS services, however, it prevents management of users and groups.
 
 - Administrators can also set different permissions to users, depending on their function within AWS. 
 
 **Below is a screenshot of some privileges provided to users:**

 - Once this is done, the user can proceed to make the group and add the user to the group. A success message will pop up, if done successfully:

- In order to test this out, we can log out of our root user account and login using our newly created account. 

**This link will allow me to login:https://sohaib-sohail.signin.aws.amazon.com/console**

- Once I enter the details correctly including username and the previously generated password, I can login into the new account.

### Changing access keys:

- Sometimes we can share our access keys which is seen as a high security risk. In order to rectify this, we can visit the IAM console page of an AWS account. 

**Under the side menu on the left, click on:** 

```
Users 
```
**Visit the option:**

```
Security Credentials
```

**Under this menu, you would need to make the current access key inactive, in order to regenerate another one.**

```
Inactive
```

**Once this is done, the user can create another unique access key.**

```
Create access key
```

This should eliminate any security risks to the AWS user account. 

## Getting Started: Set a Password Policy:

### Apply an IAM password Policy:

- After visiting the IAM dashboard page, there is one last step within the security status. This is applying an IAM password policy. 

**Under this option, it should list:**

```
Manage Password Policy
```

**Once the page loads.**

```
Set password policy
```

- This will allow us to create a password policy with number of security principles including; number of characters, character types, an expiry date and more.

Once all of these minimum password requirements are set. The security status should be updated to complete:

**This means that you have successfully completed the required security steps of securing the AWS account. All further AWS work should be done from the new user created.**

## Hands On: Intro and Regions:

### Head over to the N.Virginia Region:

- As we are testing multiple different tools, the N.Virginia region has a lot more options than other regions. So it's important to switch to this region to get comfortable with AWS's services. 

- This can be done in the top right corner, next to the user section.

## Hands On: Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2):

### Creating a instance:

- Search for EC2 in the services section of AWS. 

- Once this is done, it should pop up with the option of:

```
Launch instance
```

- To configure our server, we will be provided with a few options:

**Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):**

- In this case, we will be selecting "Amazon Linus 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type". This is one of the free tier packages which saves money.

**Choose Instance Type/Size:**

- t2.micro is a free tier, which is what we will be selecting. However, depending on the organisation and clients needs, we can customise this. 

**Configuring Instance:**

- These options can vary, for example, customising the number of instances would launch a set number of servers at the same time. For demonstration purposes, the user will be sticking to one. 

- Network, Subnet, Auto-assign Public IP will be default. 

- IAM role - Creating a new role:

**This new role will be created in a separate tab, assigned with the permission: "AmazonEC2RoleforSSM" - (Simple Systems Manager). This will be used as a method to login into the instance.**

- Once this role is created successfully. Head back to the configuring instance settings, and refresh the IAM role option to identify the new role created. 

**Adding Storage:**

- This will customise the server's storage space. We will stick with the default user's storage of 8GB. 

**Before we launch the instance, AWS will ask us to select or create a new key pair.**

- Key pairs are used to get into the server. However, as we are using SSM to login into the instance, we don't need one. So we can select the option: "Proceed without a key pair".

- Proceeding to launch an instance, it will require a few minutes before the server is fully running.
