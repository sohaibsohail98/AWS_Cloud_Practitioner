## What is Cloud Computing?

The practice of a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

On-premise: 

- People would own the servers
- People would need to hire the IT people
- People would need to pay or rent to real-estate
- People taking all the risk

Cloud Providers (AWS, Azure): 

-  Someone else owns the servers - users not responsible for the software, it's all configured by the provider. 
- Someone else hires the IT people 
- Someone else pays or rents the real-estate - to house these servers which are data servers
-  Shared responsibility for configuring cloud services and code onto the platform, someone else takes care of the rest.

Six advantages and benefits of Cloud Computing:

Trade capital expense for variable expense: 

- **No upfront cost** - On premise would mean paying for dats centres and servers

- **Pay On-Demand** - Pay as the user consumes computing resources

Benefit from massive economies of scale: 

- People already using the cloud allows users to **share the cost with other customers** to get substantial savings in their computing costs.

Stop guessing capacity:

- It eliminates the guesswork of working out what the business needs. Depending on the infrastructure, servers can be scaled up or down to meet the user's needs. This will avoid paying for idle or underutilised servers. 

Increase speed and agility:

- Resources can accessed with a **few clicks**, preventing the time frame of days or weeks to implement IT solution services to businesses. 

No costs towards running and maintaining data centres:

- **Focusing on businesses customers**, rather than powering and maintaining powerful servers.

Access global servers within minutes:

- App deployment can occur in multiple regions around the world within a few clicks. Provide lower latency and a better experience for users for a fraction of on-premise cost.

## Types of Cloud Computing:

SaaS - Software as a service - for customers:

- A completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.

- Not needing to worry how the service is maintained. Works and remains available. Examples are: Salesforce, Gmail, Office 365.

PaaS - Platform as a service - for developers:
 
 - Removes the need for the organisation to manage the underlying infrastructure. Focus on the deployment and management of your applications. 
 
 - Implies that provisioning, configuring or understanding the hardware or OS is taken care of and there is no need to worry about these. 
 
 - If a developer has an app, they can push it. For example, AWS uses Elastic Beanstalk, this is a service to deploy and scale web applications and services developed with Java, Python, Ruby, .NET, Node. js, PHP and more.
 
 - Service examples: Heroku and Engines for Google 
 
 IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service - for admins:
 
 - The basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space. 
 
 - Eliminates the need for IT staff, dats centres and hardware. Users have access to these resources to build apps
 
 - Examples are: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure
 
**All of these services are build upon each other**: 

This means PaaS relies on IaaS, if a user needed to create a platform as a service, it would create it on an Infrastructure such as AWS or Microsoft Azure.
 
 The same way, SaaS relies on PaaS. This means if a user needed to create a software as a service, it would develop it on a platform such as Heroku or AWS's Elastic Beanstalk. 
 
 ## Cloud Computing Deployment Models:
 
 **Cloud - fully utilising cloud computing:** 
 
 Services such as: Dropbox, Squarespace, Basecamp
 
 **Where it would be used:** 
  
  - Very well suited for startups because of its low costs.
  - Great for SaaS offerings
  - New projects and companies, existing infrastructure can be completely cloud-based.
  
 **On Premise - deploying resources on-premises, using virtualisation and resource management tools - also known as "private cloud"**
 
 **Where it is or would be used:**
 
 - Public sector: the government has on-premise data centres
 - Sensitive data such as Hospitals, health records recorded in private data
 - Large enterprise with heavy regulation such as Insurance companies
  
  Due to technical or political reasons, some businesses are not able to use the cloud. 
  
 **Hybrid: Using both the Cloud and On-Premise:**
 
  **Where it is or would be used:**
  
  - Banks
  
  - FinTech, Investment Management
  
  - Large Professional Service providers
  
  - Legacy on-premise
  
  **The reasons why Hybrid is used:**
   
   - Companies can adopt Cloud but they have legacy on-premise environments. 
   
   - Their customers are not comfortable with Cloud Computing, in some capacity they would use the Cloud.
